# What I learned about SEO and analytics

# I learned that a holistic view needs to be taken for your entire site to benefit from search engine optimization and analytics. Looking at the intent or purpose behind the search and understanding the search journey is essential. 

# SEO Implementation: 
# The four areas of SEO I'd focus on are; informational, commercial, navigational, and transactional which evaluates:
  # --rank
  # --page conversion
  # --user experience
  # --customer journey
  # --internal linking
  # --traffic description

 # When MOZ looked at localizing content per the market, i.e., US search for pants vs. European search for trousers there was a 24% increase. It really showed how using testing to evaluate SEO needs proved positive implementation areas for customers that maybe didn't see the need for making a change based on geographic region. Using keywords that fit the region and audience is important to successful SEO implementation.

 # What I learned most was to "be the last click", satisfy users, and provide an awesome user experience according to Cyrus Shepard in his 22 Smart Google SEO Tips for 2022.
